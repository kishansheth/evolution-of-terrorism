					Suicide bombers targeted three churches and three luxury hotels across Sri Lanka on April 21, 2019. More than 250 people were killed and hundreds other injured, making it the deadliest terror attack in 2019 so far. Numerous other attacks have already taken place in 2019, underscoring the threat terrorism continues to pose towards safety, security and stability across the world.
					<br><br>
					Different forms of terrorism exist, including state-sponsored, political and religious terrorism. Methods and tactics of terror groups have evolved over the years. To understand in what ways the transformation has taken place, we looked at the Global Terrorism Database (GTD).
					<br><br>
					Before we dive into the analysis, it is important to know how GTD defines terrorism:
					“the threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation.”
